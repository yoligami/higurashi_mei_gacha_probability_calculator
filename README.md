# higurashi-mei-gacha-probability-calculator

This is the repo for calculating and display the probability of SSR cards in higurashi mei gacha.

To make things easier, I would cosinder 10 gacha rolls only. (In other words, the single roll
would not be included in the calculation.)

Here is the list of all stuff I would like to calculate and display respective charts:

1. In x rolls(10<=x<=300), what is the probability for you to get the SSR you want with different
probability of that SSR.
2. In x rolls(10<=x<=900), what is the probability for you to get the star 6 SSR you want with different
probability of that SSR.
